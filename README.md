<img src = "img/eyes.png" width = '400'/>



## Description 
* We used CSS styling to create elements that look like human eyes
* JavaScript allowed us to make the eyeballs follow the mouse in a synchronized manner. 



## How to Run
Download all the files and open **index.html**.


## Roadmap of future improvements
In the future, I would like to add an element that resembles a mouth and can simulate a human smile.
